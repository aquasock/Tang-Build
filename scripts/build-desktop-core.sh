# This is the three steps the project has been running by hand: synthesis
# (`synth-desktop.sh`), place and route (`pnr-desktop.sh`), and packing with the
# fork's `gowin_pack`.  It exists because running them by hand cost real time:
#
#  * `pnr-desktop.sh` passes nextpnr NO `*_as_gpio` options, so the packer has to
#    be run without them too.  Passing the vendor's six (mspi, ready, done, i2c,
#    cpu, sspi) makes `gowin_pack` refuse with "i2c_as_gpio has conflicting
#    settings in nexpnr and gowin_pack", which is the packer working correctly.
#    Matching the vendor's pinout would mean passing the options to both tools,
#    and this flow does not do that today.
#  * The packer needs the fork's apycula, whose `get_pll_attrvals` handles the
#    string parameters the slang front end leaves in place; the suite's would
#    reject them.
#  * Nothing here defaults into /tmp.  A build that lives in a temporary
#    directory has cost this project a bitstream before.

# 2c. clock topology gate.
#
# A clean violation count is NOT evidence that the clocks work.  The chipdb's
# HCLK interconnect is incomplete, so nextpnr can route a clock on general
# fabric -- or complete it on "global resources only" -- and report no problem
# at all.  On 2026-10-09 a build passed every timing check here and did not
# boot on the board, while the build that does boot also fails this gate.  A
# pass has to be measured, not assumed, so every clock net is inventoried and
# any one that does not ride the dedicated network stops the build.
#
# The override exists because experimental bitstreams still have to be built to
# be tested on hardware.  It bypasses ONLY this topology gate -- never the
# setup/hold gate above -- and the build is then labelled unverified on the way
# out.  Do not describe such a build as a good core.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2c. clock topology check.
#
# NOT a demand that every clock be dedicated.  On this die a PLL's clock
# reaches the clock plane through fabric and a logic gate, and nextpnr says so
# itself: "no clock gate reaches both its source and its loads".  No build on
# record has every clock dedicated -- the hardware-proven baseline has `clk` on
# fabric for 943 sinks -- so an all-dedicated gate refuses every build forever,
# which is a wall, not a check.  What is checked instead is *regression*: the
# run is compared with the recorded profile of the hardware-proven build, and
# it stops only when a clock that was better has become worse.  The full
# topology is written beside the log, so a fabric fallback is visible and
# recorded rather than silent.
#
# A pass here still proves nothing about the clock: a run that matches the
# profile is exactly as unverified as that build is.  Only the board decides.

# is this project's existing convention in prose (`7b95d942`, `84915457`,
# `fadd00ba`) written into the filename.  It is content-addressed, so the name
# IS the identity and two builds with the same name are the same bits; it says
# nothing about anyone's repository or working tree; and it is computed here,
# on the host.  Nothing hashes on the board -- the BL616 only ever receives a
# byte stream.

# card's boot path and other tools expect them.
