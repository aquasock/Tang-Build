# This needs the FORK's nextpnr-himbaechel, not oss-cad-suite's.  The suite's
# binary carries the database published in apicula's PyPI package, which for
# GW5AST-138C has no PLL site and no clock pips, so it stops at
# "no BELs remaining to implement cell type 'PLL'".  The fork's is built
# against the database regenerated from the local Gowin install, which carries
# them.  See TOOLCHAIN.md, "Building nextpnr against the database".
#
# Point at it with NEXTPNR_HIMBAECHEL, or leave that unset to use the default
# path below.  The script refuses the suite's copy outright rather than trying
# to place and reporting a wall that is really a wrong binary.
#
# Two pieces of design-to-toolchain translation are needed first, and both are
# done here rather than by editing the design:
#
#  * nextpnr's SDC reader does not accept `//` comments, and desktop.sdc opens
#    with one.  Converted to `#`.
#  * nextpnr requires every IO to have a location.  `reset2` is declared in
#    nestang_top.sv ("button S1 and pin 48 are both resets") and used nowhere,
#    and the vendor build has no pin for it either, so it cannot be placed.
#    It is dropped -- but only after checking it really is unused, because
#    silently deleting a port that something reads would be worse than the
#    error it avoids.

The design is fine; the binary is wrong.

  `no BELs remaining to implement cell type 'PLL'` means the architecture this
  nextpnr was built with carries no PLL site -- which is the PUBLISHED
  GW5AST-138C database, not the regenerated one.  Check that the binary in use
  is the fork's and not oss-cad-suite's, and that it was built with the fork's
  apycula on PYTHONPATH for the whole build.  The usual cause is a misspelled
  -DHIMBAECHEL_GOWIN_DEVICES: CMake ignores it with only a warning and builds
  the architecture from whatever apycula it found.

See TOOLCHAIN.md, "Building nextpnr against the database".
