# ------------------------------------- string parameters back to strings --
# `read_slang` keeps a Verilog *string* parameter as a bit vector, where
# `read_verilog` keeps it a string, so a design through this front end reaches
# `gowin_pack` carrying the ASCII of "50" and "TRUE" instead of those strings.
# MEASURED: clock-smoke, synthesised by plain `synth_gowin`, has
# `FCLKIN = 50` and `CLKOUT0_EN = TRUE`; this flow's netlist has
# `0011010100110000` and `01010100010100100101010101000101` for the same
# `defparam`s.  The packer wants the strings and rejects the bit patterns --
# `float()` on the former gives 1.1e13, and the latter raises a KeyError in
# `pll_attrvals` -- which is what stopped this core packing at all.
#
# The cell library states which of the PLL's parameters are strings and which
# are numbers (`cells_xtra_gw5a.v`: 43 of the former, `FCLKIN`, `CLKFB_SEL`,
# `CLKOUT0..6_EN`, the `DYN_*` and `DE*_EN` flags; 51 of the latter, the
# dividers and delay steps).  Converting is therefore restricted to PLL-family
# cells, where it is safe by construction: a PLL's numeric parameters are
# 32-bit, so a realistic divider leaves its high bytes 0x00 and cannot decode
# as text.  A LUT is not safe -- `INIT` is 16 bits and some decode to printable
# ASCII by chance, which is how a whole-netlist rule would silently corrupt
# look-up tables -- so PLL-family cells are the scope, not the whole design.
